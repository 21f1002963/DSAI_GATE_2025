üöÄ **About the Repository**

Welcome, This repository covers GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) exam preparation for "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)"! 
This repository is designed to collaborate and share resoucers for preparation including study materials, online courses, and code examples that cover the DSAI Gate syllabus.

üìö **Syllabus Coverage**

Our repository is meticulously organized to cover the complete syllabus outlined for the DSAI section of the GATE exam. From Probability and Statistics to Linear Algebra, Calculus, Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Management and Warehousing, Machine Learning, and AI, you'll find comprehensive resources that address each topic in detail. Whether you're looking for theoretical explanations, practical examples, or coding exercises, we've got you covered.

üìÅ **Repository Structure**

To ensure a smooth and efficient learning experience, we've structured the repository with the following sections:

- [**Probability and Statistics**](#probability-and-statistics): Clear explanations, examples, and code snippets for all key concepts in Probability and Statistics.
- **Linear Algebra**: Detailed discussions on vector spaces, matrices, eigenvalues, and more.
- **Calculus and Optimization**: Exploring single-variable functions, limits, optimization techniques, and more.
- **Programming and Algorithms**: Comprehensive coverage of Python programming, data structures, and algorithms.
- **Database Management**: ER-models, relational algebra, SQL, normalization, and more.
- **Machine Learning**: Extensive explanations and hands-on examples of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
- **AI**: In-depth discussions on search algorithms, logic, reasoning, and uncertainty.
